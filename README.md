# workspace-bound-desktops

On a Linux Mint Cinnamon, this service allows having a dedicated desktop content for each workspace! Just make sure you are already using multiple workspaces and BACKUP your desktop before installation.

# Installation

- Download or Clone
- `cd /path/to/the/download/or/clone`
- `./install`

This will install a service name `wbds` on the system. Use `service wbds status` to check status.

Feel free to contribute!
