# workspace-bound-desktops

On a Linux Mint Cinnamon Desktop, this service allows having a dedicated desktop content for each workspace! Just make sure you are already using multiple workspaces and BACKUP your desktop content before installation.

# Installation

- Download and extract
- `cd /path/to/wbds`
- `./install`

This will install a service name `wbds` on the system. Use `service wbds status` to check status.
